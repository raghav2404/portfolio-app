# GitHub Actions Node.js Cache Issue - Solutions

## Issue
Persistent "Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies" error in GitHub Actions workflow.

## Multiple Solutions Applied

### Solution 1: Updated Main Workflow
Changed in `main_portfolio-rr24.yml`:
- Downgraded to `actions/setup-node@v3` (more stable)
- Removed all cache configurations
- Added Node.js version verification
- Simplified node-version to '18' (no .x suffix)

### Solution 2: Alternative Manual Installation
Created backup workflow `main_portfolio-rr24-backup.yml` with:
- Direct Node.js installation via apt-get
- Bypasses GitHub Actions setup-node entirely
- Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch)

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Clear GitHub Actions Cache
1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Actions → Caches
2. Delete all caches
3. Re-run the workflow

### Fix 2: Use Backup Workflow
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Build and deploy ASP.Net Core app (Backup)"
3. Click "Run workflow" manually

### Fix 3: Simplify Node Setup Further
Try this minimal setup in the main workflow:
```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 18
```

### Fix 4: Use Pre-installed Node
Ubuntu runners come with Node.js pre-installed:
```yaml
- name: Use pre-installed Node.js
  run: |
    which node
    node --version
    npm --version
```

## Expected Workflow Steps
After Node.js is working:
1. ✅ Setup .NET 8
2. ✅ Setup Node.js 18  
3. ✅ Install Angular CLI
4. ✅ Restore .NET packages
5. ✅ Install Angular packages
6. ✅ Build Angular app
7. ✅ Build .NET app
8. ✅ Deploy to Azure

The workflow will deploy your portfolio successfully once the Node.js setup step passes.
