# GitHub Actions Workflow Solution

## Problem Identified
You have **2 GitHub Actions workflows** causing conflicts:

1. **`azure-deploy.yml`** - Custom workflow I created
2. **`main_portfolio-rr24.yml`** - Auto-generated by Azure Portal

## Solution Applied
**Fixed the Azure-generated workflow** (`main_portfolio-rr24.yml`) to properly build your Angular + .NET application.

### Key Changes Made:
✅ **Added Node.js setup** for Angular builds
✅ **Added Angular CLI installation**  
✅ **Correct build order**: Angular first, then .NET
✅ **Fixed project paths**: Explicitly reference `PortfolioApp/PortfolioApp.csproj`
✅ **Changed to Ubuntu runners** for better compatibility

### Build Steps Now Include:
1. Setup .NET 8
2. Setup Node.js 18
3. Install Angular CLI
4. Restore .NET dependencies 
5. Install Angular dependencies
6. **Build Angular app** (`ng build --production`)
7. Build .NET application
8. Publish .NET application
9. Deploy to Azure

## What Happens Next

### When You Push Changes:
1. The **Azure-generated workflow** (`main_portfolio-rr24.yml`) will run
2. It will properly build both Angular and .NET components
3. Deploy to your `portfolio-rr24` App Service
4. Your portfolio will replace the Azure default page

### Monitoring Deployment:
- **GitHub**: Repository → Actions tab → Watch workflow progress
- **Azure Portal**: App Service → Deployment Center → View logs

## Cleanup Recommendation
After successful deployment, you can:
1. Keep the working `main_portfolio-rr24.yml` (Azure-generated, now fixed)
2. Delete the duplicate `azure-deploy.yml` via GitHub web interface

## Expected Result
Your Angular + .NET portfolio will be fully functional at:
`https://portfolio-rr24.azurewebsites.net`

The workflow is now properly configured to build and deploy your complete application stack.
