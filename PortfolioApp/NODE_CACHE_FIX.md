# Node.js Cache Error Fix

## Error Fixed
**"Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies"**

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow was looking for `package-lock.json` file at a path that doesn't exist in your repository structure.

## Solution Applied
Removed the npm cache configuration from the workflow:

### Before (Causing Error):
```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18.x'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: './PortfolioApp/ClientApp/package-lock.json'
```

### After (Fixed):
```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18.x'
```

## Additional Changes
- Changed `npm ci` to `npm install` for better compatibility
- Removed dependency on package-lock.json file

## Impact
- Build will now proceed without caching errors
- Slightly longer build times (no npm cache) but more reliable
- Angular dependencies will install correctly

Your workflow should now complete successfully without the Node.js caching error.
